VALO Stretch Switch

One-click desktop utility to toggle true stretched resolution in VALORANT and automatically restore your setup afterward.

What it does

Switches your main monitor to a custom stretched resolution (e.g. 1440×993@240).

Optionally forces single-display mode to prevent Alt-Tab monitor swapping.

Ensures VALORANT opens and stays on the primary monitor.

Optionally launches VALORANT (won’t open a second instance if already running).

Automatically reverts to default resolution and multi-monitor setup when the game closes.

Includes monitor selector + optional monitor disable.

Runs elevated automatically when required.

Designed for competitive players who want consistent stretched behavior without manually changing Windows or NVIDIA settings every time.

IMPORTANT

YOU MUST CREATE THE 1440X993 Res in your nvidia settings. Only the first time.

This is not malware, just a fast fix for an annoying process.
