VALO Stretch Switch

One-click desktop utility to toggle true stretched resolution in VALORANT and automatically restore your setup afterward.

What it does

Switches your main monitor to a custom stretched resolution (e.g. 1440×993@240).

Optionally forces single-display mode to prevent Alt-Tab monitor swapping.

Ensures VALORANT opens and stays on the primary monitor.

Optionally launches VALORANT (won’t open a second instance if already running).

Automatically reverts to default resolution and multi-monitor setup when the game closes.

Includes monitor selector + optional monitor disable.

Runs elevated automatically when required.

Designed for competitive players who want consistent stretched behavior without manually changing Windows or NVIDIA settings every time.

IMPORTANT

YOU MUST CREATE THE 1440X993 Res in your nvidia settings. Only the first time.

This is not malware, just a fast fix for an annoying process.

It may be detected as malware due to heuristic analysis, not because it contains a real virus.

The executable:

Embeds and runs PowerShell (ps2exe packages it this way).

Automatically elevates to administrator.

Modifies system display settings.

Can enable/disable monitor devices.

Launches external processes (Riot Client / VALORANT).

These behaviors are technically similar to what:

Script loaders

Administrative control tools

Remote management utilities

Some trojans

often do.

Modern antivirus engines don’t rely only on known virus signatures — they also analyze behavior.
If an application performs actions commonly associated with malware, it may be flagged as a false positive.

In short:
The detection happens because of how the program operates at a system level, not because it contains malicious code.
